## What is NVM for Mac?

NVM (Node Version Manager) for Mac is a **command-line utility** that allows you to easily install, manage, and switch between multiple versions of Node.js on macOS. Instead of being limited to a single version of Node.js, NVM gives you full control, ensuring compatibility with different projects and frameworks.

With NVM, you can:

* Install the latest Node.js releases or specific versions.
* Switch between Node.js versions instantly.
* Use different Node.js versions for different projects.
* Avoid conflicts when working with multiple development environments.

This makes it an essential tool for developers who work with JavaScript, TypeScript, or full-stack frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and Next.js.

The tool integrates seamlessly with macOS Terminal and works on both **Intel and Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)**. Itâ€™s widely used by web developers, backend engineers, and DevOps professionals who need reliable version management without complicated setup.

Unlike installing Node.js manually, NVM ensures that your environment stays clean. You can remove outdated versions, install new ones, and test applications against different Node.js releases quickly. For teams, this guarantees consistent development environments across machines.
